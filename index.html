                As the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve with the Delta and Delta plus variant,
                debates have come up about whether COVID-19 vaccinations should be required to attend public schools in
                the fall. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for use in children and teens ages 12 and
                older. Both Pfizer and Moderna are conducting vaccine trials in children between the ages of 6 months
                and 11 years old. Experts expect young children to have access to the COVID-19 vaccines by the fall or
                mid-winter. Several states, including Florida, Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, Arkansas,
                Oklahoma, and Utah have already enacted legislation to ban public schools and universities from
                requiring students to have a COVID-19 vaccine to attend classes. But pediatricians and public health
                experts point out that several other routine vaccinations are already required in the United States for
                children to attend childcare or school. “Vaccine mandates have been around for a while, and they work,”
                Angela Shen, ScD, MPH, visiting research scientist at the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s
                Hospital of Philadelphia and retired captain in the U.S. Public Health Services, told Healthline. “In
                the United States, we have a long history of requiring certain shots in order to go back to school to
                control vaccine preventable diseases,” Shen added.
